    "question": "A 58-year-old female smoker with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis is on ipratropium bromide and albuterol inhalers, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen. She presents with respiratory distress for 2 days accompanied by increased thick, yellow sputum production, low grade fever, and increasing confusion. On examination she is mildly obtunded but arousable, BP 160/100, pulse 115/min, RR 30/min, O2 saturation 84% on her usual 3 L/min nasal cannula oxygen. She is using accessory muscles to breath, has diffuse wheezing and rhonchi bilaterally, a prolonged expiratory phase, distant but regular heart sounds, and no peripheral edema.Arterial blood gases (ABGs) on arrival are as follows:pH: 7.20,PO2: 70 mm HgPCO2: 65 mm Hgcalculated HCO3 29 mEq/L.Electrolytes return shortly thereafter as follows:Na: 140 mEq/LK: 5.1 mEq/LHCO3: 29 mEq/LCl: 100 mEq/LBUN 20 mg/dL creatinine 1.5 mg/dLglucose 89 mg/dL.After prompt initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (Bi-pap), blood cultures, toxicology screen, intravenous fluids, and IV antibiotics, you have time to consider the patient's metabolic situation. Choose the answer which best describes the acid-base condition and its etiology.",
    "exp": "Patients with severe COPD often have a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 in the 50 to 60 mm Hg range. They are unable to ventilate sufficiently to correct the acidotic situation this creates. The kidney then compensates by retaining HCO3 . This results in a new steady state in which the patient has a near-normal pH on their blood gas despite the chronically elevated CO2 . In this question the further deterioration in the patient's respiratory status due to COPD exacerbation has caused further CO2 retention and a superimposed acute respiratory acidosis on top of the chronic respiratory acidosis. Salicylate overdose normally causes an anion gap acidosis and the AG is normal here. Volume depletion, especially due to recurrent vomiting, can lead to a contraction alkalosis, but this patient's acidosis indicates that the elevated bicarbonate level is caused by renal compensation for her chronic CO2 retention.",

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman with long-standing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and controlled systolic congestive heart failure following a previous anterior myocardial infarction presents for a routine office visit. She denies any significant complaints. The patient faithfully takes her glargine insulin, lisinopril, carvedilol, furosemide, and aspirin. On examination her blood pressure is 122/82, pulse 85, RR 14, with clear lungs, regular heartbeat, and 1+ bilateral pedal edema. You review the chart and find that her baseline creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration (GFR) rate of 42 mL/min.

What is the most common pathophysiologic scenario leading to this acid-base disturbance?",
    "exp": "Type 4 renal tubular acidosis occurs when there is distal nephron dysfunction leading to disproportionate levels of hyperkalemia and acidosis compared to the degree of kidney disease encountered. This is most commonly seen in patients with long-standing diabetes and can be exacerbated by the use of non-steroidal, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A patient with congestive heart failure and renal hypoperfusion can develop prerenal azotemia, but you would expect clinical evidence of decompensated heart failure and an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio (well above 10/1). A patient who has been over diuresis will tend to have hypokalemia, a higher BUN/Cr ratio and a contraction alkalosis. Salicylate poisoning typically requires a significant ingestion (not mentioned in this question) and causes a wide-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Use of ACE inhibitors can lead to hyperkalemia but neither ACE inhibitors nor beta-blockers typically lead to a Type 4 RTA.",

Dapsone is bacteriostatic. It commonly causes mild haemolysis and rarely anaemia. Clofazimine is a red, fat-soluble crystalline dye, weakly bactericidal for M. leprae. Skin discoloration (red to purple-black) and ichthyosis are troublesome side-effects, paicularly on pale skins. New bactericidal drugs against M. leprae have been identified, notably fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin and ofloxacin). Minocycline and clarithromycin may also be used.

What is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "exp": "This patient's history and physical exam are consistent with an intestinal obstruction. An intestinal obstruction must be ruled out because, if it goes undiagnosed and untreated, it can result in a bowel perforation. This patient has a history of a previous abdominal surgery, which places her at risk for adhesions. Beginning in the second trimester, the gravid uterus can push on these adhesions and result in a bowel strangulation. Common symptoms of intestinal obstruction include colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis. Signs of a bowel obstruction include abdominal tenderness and decreased bowel sounds. Fever and an elevated white blood cell count are present with bowel strangulation and necrosis. This patient has a mild leukocytosis, which is also characteristic of normal pregnancy. In order to rule out an intestinal obstruction, an upright or lateral decubitus abdominal x-ray should be done to identify the presence of distended loops of bowel and air-fluid levels, which confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and nasogastric suction; patients who do not respond to conservative therapy may require surgery. Bowel stimulants such as laxatives or enemas should not be administered. Pregnant women are predisposed to constipation secondary to decreased bowel motility induced by elevated levels of progesterone. The symptoms of nausea and emesis in this patient and the presence of a low-grade fever prompt further workup because her presentation is not consistent with uncomplicated constipation. In pregnancy, constipation can be treated with hydration, increased fiber in the diet, and the use of stool softeners. The patient's sudden onset of emesis and abdominal pain is not consistent with the normal presentation of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis typically has an onset in the early part of the first trimester and usually resolves by 16 weeks. It is characterized by intractable vomiting causing severe weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The ingestion of spicy foods during pregnancy can cause or exacerbate gastric reflux or \"heartburn\" but would not cause the severity of the symptoms described in this patient's presentation.

Total protein 6.2 g/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, BUN 16 mg/dL, creatinine 0.75 mg/dL, and calcium 9.2 mg/dL. Serum protein electrophoresis reveals a sharp, narrow spike, serum immunofixation reveals M-protein 1.2 gm/dL, bone marrow examination reveals less than 10% of monoclonal plasma cells. A skeletal survey is negative for any lytic lesions.",
    "exp": "Multiple myeloma would best explain this patient's presentation. The onset of myeloma is often insidious. Pain caused by bone involvement, anemia, renal insufficiency, and bacterial pneumonia often follow. This patient presented with fatigue and bone pain, then developed bacterial pneumonia probably secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae, an encapsulated organism for which antibody to the polysaccharide capsule is not adequately produced by the myeloma patient. There is also evidence for renal insufficiency. Hypercalcemia is frequently seen in patients with multiple myeloma and may be life-threatening. Definitive diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made by demonstrating greater than 30% plasma cells in the bone marrow. Seventy-five percent of patients with myeloma will have a monoclonal M spike on serum protein electrophoresis, but 25% will produce primarily Bence-Jones proteins, which, because of their small size, do not accumulate in the serum but are excreted in the urine. Urine protein electrophoresis will identify these patients. Approximately 1% of patients with myeloma will present with a non-secretory myeloma. Patients with non-secretory myeloma have no M-protein on serum/urine electrophoresis and immunofixation; the diagnosis can be made only with bone marrow biopsy. The bone scan in myeloma is usually negative. The radionuclide is taken up by osteoblasts, and myeloma is usually a purely osteolytic process. Renal biopsy might show monoclonal protein deposition in the kidney or intratubular casts but would not be the first diagnostic procedure. Rouleaux formation in peripheral smear is a characteristic finding of myeloma, although it is neither sensitive nor specific.Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia may cause hyper-viscosity syndrome with CNS manifestations including headache, blurring of vision, dizziness, nystagmus, ataxic gait, drowsiness, or even coma. Peripheral neuropathy, coagulopathy, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms are often present. An unusual gap between serum total protein and albumin indicates hyperglobulinemia, and a monoclonal IgM spike on serum protein electrophoresis helps establish an initial diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy revealing more than 10% of lymphoid and plasmacytoid cells confirms the diagnosis. Unlike multiple myeloma, bony lesions are uncommon in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, whereas lymphadenopathy and organomegaly are uncommon in myeloma.Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell disorder which is often suspected and detected incidentally from routine blood workup. The patients are asymptomatic with no end-organ damage such as renal failure, hypercalcemia, anemia, or lytic bone lesion. The serum electrophoresis reveals an M spike but the amount of M-protein on immunofixation is usually less than 3 gm/dL and bone marrow contains less than 10% of monoclonal plasma cells. Monitoring of patients is important since MGUS can progress to multiple myeloma over a period of time. It is recommended to get the first evaluation 6 months after initial diagnosis followed by annual or biannual checkup.",

Chromosome analysis demonstrates a translocation between the immunuglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 and an unidentified gene on chromosome 8. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his phenotype?",
    "exp": "This case is an example of Burkitt's lymphoma, which may affect the tonsils or other lymphoid tissues. The translocation places the myc oncogene on chromosome 8 downstream of the very active heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, activating myc gene expression in B cells and their derivatives. The translocation is likely an aberrant form of the normal DNA rearrangements that generate unique heavy chain genes in each B cell. The translocation joins one chromosome 8 to one chromosome 14, leaving their homologues unaffected. The cause for the phenotype must therefore be trans-acting, since cis-acting effects would peain only to the translocated loci and not affect the homologous untranslocated loci. Activation of a tumor-promoting gene (oncogene) on chromosome 8 could produce an enlarged tonsil, while underactivity of immunoglobulin production due to one-half expression could decrease immune function but would not completely ablate the processes in choices a, b, d, and e. At the genetic level, trans-acting events are autosomal dominant in that one of the two homologous loci is abnormal and produces a phenotype.

    "question": "In the beginning of resuscitation effos, 0.5 mg of epinephrine is administered subcutaneously. Which adrenergic receptors, in which tissues, are responsible for the beneficial effect of epinephrine in this patient?",
    "exp": "Epinephrine is a non selective adrenergic agonist and a valuable resuscitative drug because of its effects at multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. In the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, accelerates hea rate, causes constriction of vascular smooth muscle, and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. The principal pharmacologic effects of epinephrine that are beneficial in anaphylaxis are mediated : alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, beta-1 receptors in the hea, resulting in increased contractility, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation and relief of bronchoconstriction. (One simple mnemonic for the respective locations of beta1 and beta2 receptors is \"one hea, two lungs.\") Beta-2 receptors are also found, however, in vascular smooth muscle (especially in skeletal muscle beds), were, just as in bronchial smooth muscle, they promote relaxation. (Epinephrine dilates skeletal muscle vascular beds to maximize oxygen delivery for the \"fight-or-flight\" response.) The resulting vasodilation in skeletal muscle vascular beds would, by itself, tend to decrease blood pressure, which might tend to worsen the effects of anaphylactic shock, but this effect is mitigated by the intense alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasoconstriction in multiple beds. The principal action of alpha-2 receptors is at the presynaptic nerve terminal, where receptor stimulation reduces the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminal. Epinephrine does stimulate these receptors, but it does not really contribute to the beneficial actions of epinephrine in resuscitation. Alpha-2 receptors are not located in the hea (except at presynaptic nerve terminals), alpha-2 receptors do not have a significant beneficial effect in resuscitation, and beta-1 receptors are not located in bronchial smooth muscle, but are located in the hea. Beta-1 receptors are located in the hea, not in bronchial smooth muscle. The adrenergic receptor that produces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation is beta-2. Alpha-2 receptors are located primarily at presynaptic nerve terminals, and because the beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cause vasodilation, this not a helpful effect of epinephrine in this case. Also Know: Epinephrine is indicated for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and acute asthma exacerbations. It is considered a first-line agent in the treatment of cardiac arrest (i.e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity). Epinephrine also causes bronchodilation and antagonizes the effects of histamine. Epinephrine significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption and thus can exacerbate ventricular irritability in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Extravasation causes necrosis and sloughing, and requires prompt infiltration of the affected area with phentolamine. Ref: Miller B.A., Clements E.A. (2011). Chapter 24.

His hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dl, platelet count 37 x 109/L and total leukocyte count 70 x 109/L, which included 80% eosinophils.

Journal Source: Ann Hematol. 2000 May;79(5):272-4. Authors: Jain P, Kumar R, Gujral S, Kumar A, Singh A, Jain Y, Dubey S, Anand M, Arya LS. A four-year-old boy presented with marked peripheral blood eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count of 54 x 10(9)/1), features of hypereosinophilic syndrome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L2), the latter characterized by the presence of granular blasts. Blasts were negative for myeloperoxidase, non-specific esterase, acid phosphatase, periodic-acid Schiff stain, and toluidine blue. They exhibited an early pre-B immunophenotype (TdT, CD19, CDIO, CD20 and CD22 positive) and stained negative for T (CD7, CD2, CD5 and CD3) and myeloid markers (MPO, CD33 and CD13). Chromosomal analysis revealed a normal karyotype. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first repo of the coexistence of granular ALL and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Why Hypereosinophillic Syndrome Option A Explanation Idiopathic hypereosinophillic syndrome is a rare condition characterized by extremely high levels of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. (80% of (70 x 109) Leucocytes were eosinophils in this patient) Clinical picture of dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing etc is fuher suggestive of HES. This is differentiated from eosinophillic leukaemia by the absence of eosinophilic blast cells.

    "question": "A 64-year-old man is evaluated because of weakness and difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation. The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit 2 weeks ago because of septic shock related to alcoholism, pneumonia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. He had developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as acute kidney injury. His pulmonary infiltrates had responded to appropriate intravenous antibiotics and his hypotension had responded to intravenous norepinephrine. Now the patient is alert and responsive to verbal commands, is afebrile with blood pressure of 114/74 but has not tolerated several trials of weaning from the ventilator. On physical examination, the patient is cooperative. Cranial nerves are normal. Muscle strength is poor, especially in distal musculature, where he displays only 2/5 strength in the hands and feet. Proximal strength is 3/5. Ankle and knee reflexes are unobtainable. Sensory examination is difficult because of problems communicating with the patient but suggests distal sensory loss in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show that his creatinine level has spontaneously improved to 2.4 mg/dL. Electrolytes are normal, and the patient has a mild normochromic normocytic anemia with resolving leukocytosis. Serum creatine kinase is 78 units/L (normal <140). What is the most likely cause of his weakness?",
    "exp": "This patient suffers from critical care polyneuropathy, which affects 25% to 50% of ICU patients who have suffered multiorgan failure or who have required long-term mechanical ventilation. It typically presents with motor weakness and difficulty in weaning the patient from the ventilator. Cranial nerves are spared. Distal reflex loss, sensory changes in neuropathic distribution, and normal CK help distinguish it from critical care myopathy. Both conditions can coexist in the same patient and distinction between the two conditions may not be important, as treatment of both conditions is supportive. Patients usually improve slowly with time, but prolonged dependence on the ventilator as well as weakness and sensory loss lasting months or years often occur. The cause of critical care polyneuropathy is unknown, but axonal degeneration on nerve conduction studies is characteristic.Loss of myosin characterizes the closely related condition of critical care myopathy, but sensory changes and reflex loss would not be anticipated in a myopathic process. Neuromuscular blockade again would not cause sensory and reflex changes. Thiamine deficiency can be provoked in a malnourished patient (such as one suffering from chronic alcoholism) but would be associated with nystagmus, ataxia, and mental status changes rather than distal weakness and neuropathy. Demyelination (rather than axonal degeneration) is associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome, but this condition would be very unlikely in this ICU patient without antecedent viral or Campylobacter infection.",

    "question": "A 25 year old patient with asthma arrives at the emergency depament complaining of extreme shoness of breath. He has been compliant with his medications, which are metaproterenol and inhaled betamethasone. Over the past 6 hours, his wheezing and shoness of breath have become increasingly severe. At present, his blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg and with deep inspiration falls to 116/56 mm Hg. His pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 32/min and labored. There is retraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscles with inspiration. There are soft wheezes and poor air movement diffusely throughout both lung fields. His peak expiratory flow rate is 60 L/min, and he is immediately staed on an albuterol nebulizer and given IV hydrocoisone. His aerial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.55, pCO2 of 21 mm Hg, and a pO2 of 60 mm Hg. Twenty minutes later, a repeat peak flow rate is still 60 L/min. A repeat aerial blood gas reveals that his pH is now 7.46, his pCO2 is now 34 mm Hg, and his pO2 is 64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "exp": "This patient is having a very severe asthmatic attack, as demonstrated by his severe shoness of breath, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and variation in blood pressure with breathing (due to establishing a very negative intrathoracic pressure with forced attempts at inspiration). The initial pO2 is markedly decreased at 60 (compared to the normal 100) mm Hg. His pCO2 is also decreased at 21 mm Hg initially, due to \"blowing off CO2\" with his increased respirations while trying to get enough oxygen. This causes his respiratory alkalosis with pH 7.55. He is then treated, but the treatment improves his pO2 only slightly. Despite this, his pCO2 rises, and his pH returns toward normal. This does not mean he is getting better. Instead, we are seeing worsening respiratory failure as his ability to ventilate decreases, causing the inappropriate rise in pCO2 even though he is still very badly hypoxic. This patient should therefore be prepared for possible intubation if there is not immediate improvement. Epinephrine no longer is used in the management protocols of acute asthma because of its high rate of toxicity. Administering 100% oxygen may be an adjunctive therapy, but at this point the patient is probably saturating above 90% anyway. Ref: Corbridge T., Hall J.B. (2005). Chapter 40. Status Asthmaticus.

    "exp": "A ruptured abdominal aneurysm is a surgical emergency often accompanied by serious hypotension and vascular collapse before surgery and massive fluid shifts with renal failure after surgery. In this case, all the hemodynamic parameters indicate inadequate intravascular volume, and the patient is therefore suffering from hypovolemic shock. The low urine output indicates poor renal perfusion, while the high urine-specific gravity indicates adequate renal function with compensatory free-water conservation. The administration of a vasopressor agent would ceainly raise the blood pressure, but it would do so by increasing peripheral vascular resistance and thereby fuher decrease tissue perfusion. The deleterious effects of shock would be increased. A vasodilating agent to lower the systemic vascular resistance would lead to profound hypotension and possibly complete vascular collapse because of pooling of an already depleted vascular volume. This patient's blood pressure is critically dependent on an elevated systemic vascular resistance. A diuretic would exacerbate the patient's existing volume depletion. To properly treat this patient, rapid fluid infusion and expansion of the intravascular volume must be undeaken. This can be easily done with lactated Ringer solution or blood (or both) until improvements in such parameters as the PCWP, urine output, and blood pressure are noted.",

He takes metoprolol for hypertension and naproxen for the arthritis. He has occasionally awakened in the night with mild dyspnea relieved by sitting up but has not noticed edema. Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows stable left ventricular hypertrophy; no Q waves are seen. Chest x-ray shows increased interstitial markings and some cephalization of flow to the upper lobe vessels. The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%). What is the likely pathogenesis of this patient's dyspnea?",
    "exp": "The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF.",

Abdominal aneurysms are commonly asymptomatic, but acute rupture may occur without warning. Some will expand and become painful, with pain as a harbinger of rupture. The risk of rupture increases with the size of the aneurysm The 5-year risk of rupture is 1% to 2% if the aneurysm is less than 5 cm, but 20% to 40% if the size is greater than 5 cm Other studies indicate that, in patients with AAAs less than 5.5 cm, there is no difference in mortality rate between those followed with ultrasound and those who undergo elective aneurysmal repair. Therefore, operative repair is typically recommended in asymptomatic individuals when the AAA diameter is greater than 5.5 cm; other indications for surgery are rapid expansion or onset of symptoms. With careful preoperative evaluation and postoperative care, the surgical mortality rate should be less than 1% to 2%.

    "exp": "The iron concentration and iron-binding capacity are low; however, in contrast to the finding in anemia of iron deficiency, the serum ferritin level is increased. This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

    "question": "A scientist has developed an adipocyte cell line that, at 42degC, cannot degrade triglycerides to glycerol and free fatty acids. At 25degC, the triglyceride degradation is normal. Which one of the following best reflects enzymes in which a temperature-sensitive mutation may lead to this phenotype?",
    "exp": "Insulin levels decrease, and glucagon levels rise, stimulating lipolysis. (Epinephrine and other hormones promote lipolysis by the same mechanism.)a. cAMP levels rise, and PKA is activated.b. PKA phosphorylates perilipin-1, which then dissociates from the enzyme ATGL.c. When free of perilipin-1, ATGL is active and converts triacylglycerol to a free fatty acid and DAG.d. PKA directly phosphorylates and activates hormone sensitive lipase, which converts DAG to a free fatty acid and monoacylglycerol.e. Monoglyceride lipase then converts the monoacylglycerol to a free fatty acid and glycerol.The hormone-sensitive lipase of adipose tissue is responsible for degrading diacylglycerol to a free fatty acid and monoacylglycerol. The enzyme is activated by glucagon via a cAMP-mediated process (the activation of protein kinase A). Thus, mutations in PKA or the glucagon receptor may interfere with the eventual phosphorylation and activation of the hormone-sensitive lipase. Adenylate kinase is not involved in this cascade (although a mutation in adenylate cyclase would be involved, as that is the enzyme that produces cAMP). The insulin receptor promotes triglyceride synthesis and storage in the adipocyte, so a mutation in the insulin receptor would not promote triglyceride degradation. Glycerol kinase is only expressed in the liver and is not present in adipose cells.",

    "question": "A 66-year-old man has experienced fatigue, a 5-kg weight loss, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort for 10 months. On physical examination, he has marked splenomegaly; there is no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 30.5%; MCV, 89 gm3; platelet count, 94,000/mm3; and WBC count, 14,750/mm3 with 55% segmented neutrophils, 9% bands, 20% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes, 4% metamyelocytes, 3% myelocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 2 nucleated RBCs per 100 WBCs. The peripheral blood smear also shows teardrop cells. The serum uric acid level is 12 mg/dL. A bone marrow biopsy specimen shows extensive marrow fibrosis and clusters of atypical megakaryocytes. Which of the following is most likely to account for the enlargement in this patient's spleen?",
    "exp": "Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia is a myeloproliferative disorder that is also a stem cell disorder in which neoplastic megakaryocytes secrete fibrogenic factors leading to marrow fibrosis. The neoplastic clone then shifts to the spleen, where it shows trilineage hematopoietic proliferation (extramedullary hematopoiesis), in which megakaryocytes are prominent. The marrow fibrosis and the extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen fail to regulate orderly release of leukocytes into the blood. The peripheral blood has immature RBC and WBC precursors (leukoerythroblastic picture). Hematopoietic cell proliferation and turnover increases purine metabolism and uric acid production. Teardrop RBCs are misshapen RBCs that are seen when marrow undergoes fibrosis. Marrow injury also can be the result of other causes (e.g., metastatic tumors, irradiation). These causes also can give rise to a leukoerythroblastic picture, but splenic enlargement with trilineage proliferation usually is not seen. The other causes mentioned - Hodgkin lymphoma, portal hypertension, and Histoplasma capsulatum infection - can cause splenic enlargement, but not marrow fibrosis. Metastases to the spleen are uncommon.",
