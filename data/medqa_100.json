    "question": "Background and Methods:\nAldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?",

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008).

    "question": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nAn 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?\"\n\"High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health\nBackground\nHigh-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.\n160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.\nInterventions\nThe intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nData on incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.\nResults\nTable - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.\n*Adjusted for income and family history of psychiatric illness.\nMajor Depressive Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Bipolar Disorder (I or II) without Psychosis Any Psychotic Disorder\nHazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value\nControl 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] --\nAfterschool Enrichment 0.69 (0.59–0.87) < 0.001 0.80 (0.74–0.92) 0.02 0.64 (0.59–1.35) 0.34 0.84 (0.51–1.23) 0.22\nConclusions\nThis study highlights the potential of high-quality afterschool programming during childhood in promoting long-term adult mental health.\nSource of funding: Wisconsin Children's Mental Health Foundation, National Early Childhood Education Coalition\"",

    "question": "Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\nFindings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ significantly between the 2 study groups.\nBased on the best interpretation of the results of this clinical trial, which of the following statements is most accurate?",
    "answer": "Carvedilol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure as compared to metoprolol.",
    "options": {

    "question": "A 1-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for a follow-up appointment. He was recently diagnosed with failure to thrive and developmental delay. His weight is 7 kg (15.4 lb), height is 61 cm (24 in), and head circumference is 42 cm (16.5 in). The patient’s father had a younger sister who suffered from mental and physical delay and died at a very young age. The patient was able to raise his head at the age of 7 months and began to sit alone only recently. He babbles, coos, and smiles to other people. On presentation, his blood pressure is 75/40 mm Hg, heart rate is 147/min, respiratory rate is 28/min, and temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F). He has a coarse face with small deep orbits, proptotic eyes, big lips, and gingival hyperplasia. His skin is pale with decreased elasticity. His lung and heart sounds are normal. Abdominal examination reveals diminished anterior abdominal wall muscle tone and hepatomegaly. Muscle tone is increased in all groups of muscles on both upper and lower extremities. The physician becomes concerned and performs testing for the suspected hereditary disease. A blood test shows increased lysosomal enzyme concentration in the serum and decreased N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc phosphotransferase) activity within the leukocytes. Which of the statements listed below describes the mechanism of the patient’s condition?",
