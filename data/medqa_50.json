    "question": "Background and Methods:\nAldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?",

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008).

    "question": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nAn 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?\"\n\"High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health\nBackground\nHigh-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.\n160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.\nInterventions\nThe intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nData on incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.\nResults\nTable - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.\n*Adjusted for income and family history of psychiatric illness.\nMajor Depressive Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Bipolar Disorder (I or II) without Psychosis Any Psychotic Disorder\nHazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value\nControl 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] --\nAfterschool Enrichment 0.69 (0.59–0.87) < 0.001 0.80 (0.74–0.92) 0.02 0.64 (0.59–1.35) 0.34 0.84 (0.51–1.23) 0.22\nConclusions\nThis study highlights the potential of high-quality afterschool programming during childhood in promoting long-term adult mental health.\nSource of funding: Wisconsin Children's Mental Health Foundation, National Early Childhood Education Coalition\"",

Patient states a gradual onset of symptoms approximately five days ago that have been getting steadily worse. He reports that he has trouble getting up and walking across a room before becoming short of breath. Past medical history is significant for a mechanical AVR three years ago for severe aortic stenosis, removal of a benign polyp last year following a colonoscopy, and a tooth extraction 2 weeks ago. Current medications are warfarin 5 mg orally daily, rosuvastatin 20 mg orally daily, and enalapril 10 mg orally twice daily. Vital signs are: temperature 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure 100/65 mm Hg, pulse 96/min, respiration rate 18/min, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. On physical exam, patient is alert but dyspneic. Cardiac exam is significant for a systolic ejection murmur that is loudest at the upper right sternal border and radiates to the carotids. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Splenomegaly is present. Extremities are pale and cool to the touch. Laboratory tests are significant for:\nSodium  136 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.1 mEqL\nChloride  107 mEq/L\nBicarbonate 21 mEq/L\nBUN  13 mg/dL\nCreatinine  1.0 mg/dL\nGlucose (fasting)   75 mg/dL\n  Bilirubin, conjugated 0.3 mg/dL\nBilirubin, total   1.1 mg/dL\nAST (SGOT) 34 U/L\nALT (SGPT)      40 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 39 U/L\n  WBC            12,500/mm3\nRBC 5.15 x 106/mm3\nHematocrit  32.1%\nHemoglobin  13.0 g/dL\nPlatelet count    215,000/mm3\n  Troponin I (cTnI)  < 0.02 ng/mL\nINR   2.4\nChest X-ray shows no evidence of dehiscence or damage to the mechanical valve. ECG shows the following in the picture. Transesophageal echocardiography shows a possible large vegetation on one of the mechanical aortic valve leaflets.  Left ventricular ejection fraction is 45% due to outflow tract obstruction. High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are started. Blood cultures x 2 are drawn.
