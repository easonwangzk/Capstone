    "question": "A 58-year-old female smoker with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis is on ipratropium bromide and albuterol inhalers, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen. She presents with respiratory distress for 2 days accompanied by increased thick, yellow sputum production, low grade fever, and increasing confusion. On examination she is mildly obtunded but arousable, BP 160/100, pulse 115/min, RR 30/min, O2 saturation 84% on her usual 3 L/min nasal cannula oxygen. She is using accessory muscles to breath, has diffuse wheezing and rhonchi bilaterally, a prolonged expiratory phase, distant but regular heart sounds, and no peripheral edema.Arterial blood gases (ABGs) on arrival are as follows:pH: 7.20,PO2: 70 mm HgPCO2: 65 mm Hgcalculated HCO3 29 mEq/L.Electrolytes return shortly thereafter as follows:Na: 140 mEq/LK: 5.1 mEq/LHCO3: 29 mEq/LCl: 100 mEq/LBUN 20 mg/dL creatinine 1.5 mg/dLglucose 89 mg/dL.After prompt initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (Bi-pap), blood cultures, toxicology screen, intravenous fluids, and IV antibiotics, you have time to consider the patient's metabolic situation. Choose the answer which best describes the acid-base condition and its etiology.",
    "exp": "Patients with severe COPD often have a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 in the 50 to 60 mm Hg range. They are unable to ventilate sufficiently to correct the acidotic situation this creates. The kidney then compensates by retaining HCO3 . This results in a new steady state in which the patient has a near-normal pH on their blood gas despite the chronically elevated CO2 . In this question the further deterioration in the patient's respiratory status due to COPD exacerbation has caused further CO2 retention and a superimposed acute respiratory acidosis on top of the chronic respiratory acidosis. Salicylate overdose normally causes an anion gap acidosis and the AG is normal here. Volume depletion, especially due to recurrent vomiting, can lead to a contraction alkalosis, but this patient's acidosis indicates that the elevated bicarbonate level is caused by renal compensation for her chronic CO2 retention.",

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman with long-standing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and controlled systolic congestive heart failure following a previous anterior myocardial infarction presents for a routine office visit. She denies any significant complaints. The patient faithfully takes her glargine insulin, lisinopril, carvedilol, furosemide, and aspirin. On examination her blood pressure is 122/82, pulse 85, RR 14, with clear lungs, regular heartbeat, and 1+ bilateral pedal edema. You review the chart and find that her baseline creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration (GFR) rate of 42 mL/min.

What is the most common pathophysiologic scenario leading to this acid-base disturbance?",
    "exp": "Type 4 renal tubular acidosis occurs when there is distal nephron dysfunction leading to disproportionate levels of hyperkalemia and acidosis compared to the degree of kidney disease encountered. This is most commonly seen in patients with long-standing diabetes and can be exacerbated by the use of non-steroidal, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A patient with congestive heart failure and renal hypoperfusion can develop prerenal azotemia, but you would expect clinical evidence of decompensated heart failure and an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio (well above 10/1). A patient who has been over diuresis will tend to have hypokalemia, a higher BUN/Cr ratio and a contraction alkalosis. Salicylate poisoning typically requires a significant ingestion (not mentioned in this question) and causes a wide-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Use of ACE inhibitors can lead to hyperkalemia but neither ACE inhibitors nor beta-blockers typically lead to a Type 4 RTA.",

Dapsone is bacteriostatic. It commonly causes mild haemolysis and rarely anaemia. Clofazimine is a red, fat-soluble crystalline dye, weakly bactericidal for M. leprae. Skin discoloration (red to purple-black) and ichthyosis are troublesome side-effects, paicularly on pale skins. New bactericidal drugs against M. leprae have been identified, notably fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin and ofloxacin). Minocycline and clarithromycin may also be used.

What is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "exp": "This patient's history and physical exam are consistent with an intestinal obstruction. An intestinal obstruction must be ruled out because, if it goes undiagnosed and untreated, it can result in a bowel perforation. This patient has a history of a previous abdominal surgery, which places her at risk for adhesions. Beginning in the second trimester, the gravid uterus can push on these adhesions and result in a bowel strangulation. Common symptoms of intestinal obstruction include colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis. Signs of a bowel obstruction include abdominal tenderness and decreased bowel sounds. Fever and an elevated white blood cell count are present with bowel strangulation and necrosis. This patient has a mild leukocytosis, which is also characteristic of normal pregnancy. In order to rule out an intestinal obstruction, an upright or lateral decubitus abdominal x-ray should be done to identify the presence of distended loops of bowel and air-fluid levels, which confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and nasogastric suction; patients who do not respond to conservative therapy may require surgery. Bowel stimulants such as laxatives or enemas should not be administered. Pregnant women are predisposed to constipation secondary to decreased bowel motility induced by elevated levels of progesterone. The symptoms of nausea and emesis in this patient and the presence of a low-grade fever prompt further workup because her presentation is not consistent with uncomplicated constipation. In pregnancy, constipation can be treated with hydration, increased fiber in the diet, and the use of stool softeners. The patient's sudden onset of emesis and abdominal pain is not consistent with the normal presentation of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis typically has an onset in the early part of the first trimester and usually resolves by 16 weeks. It is characterized by intractable vomiting causing severe weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The ingestion of spicy foods during pregnancy can cause or exacerbate gastric reflux or \"heartburn\" but would not cause the severity of the symptoms described in this patient's presentation.

Total protein 6.2 g/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, BUN 16 mg/dL, creatinine 0.75 mg/dL, and calcium 9.2 mg/dL. Serum protein electrophoresis reveals a sharp, narrow spike, serum immunofixation reveals M-protein 1.2 gm/dL, bone marrow examination reveals less than 10% of monoclonal plasma cells. A skeletal survey is negative for any lytic lesions.",
    "exp": "Multiple myeloma would best explain this patient's presentation. The onset of myeloma is often insidious. Pain caused by bone involvement, anemia, renal insufficiency, and bacterial pneumonia often follow. This patient presented with fatigue and bone pain, then developed bacterial pneumonia probably secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae, an encapsulated organism for which antibody to the polysaccharide capsule is not adequately produced by the myeloma patient. There is also evidence for renal insufficiency. Hypercalcemia is frequently seen in patients with multiple myeloma and may be life-threatening. Definitive diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made by demonstrating greater than 30% plasma cells in the bone marrow. Seventy-five percent of patients with myeloma will have a monoclonal M spike on serum protein electrophoresis, but 25% will produce primarily Bence-Jones proteins, which, because of their small size, do not accumulate in the serum but are excreted in the urine. Urine protein electrophoresis will identify these patients. Approximately 1% of patients with myeloma will present with a non-secretory myeloma. Patients with non-secretory myeloma have no M-protein on serum/urine electrophoresis and immunofixation; the diagnosis can be made only with bone marrow biopsy. The bone scan in myeloma is usually negative. The radionuclide is taken up by osteoblasts, and myeloma is usually a purely osteolytic process. Renal biopsy might show monoclonal protein deposition in the kidney or intratubular casts but would not be the first diagnostic procedure. Rouleaux formation in peripheral smear is a characteristic finding of myeloma, although it is neither sensitive nor specific.Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia may cause hyper-viscosity syndrome with CNS manifestations including headache, blurring of vision, dizziness, nystagmus, ataxic gait, drowsiness, or even coma. Peripheral neuropathy, coagulopathy, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms are often present. An unusual gap between serum total protein and albumin indicates hyperglobulinemia, and a monoclonal IgM spike on serum protein electrophoresis helps establish an initial diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy revealing more than 10% of lymphoid and plasmacytoid cells confirms the diagnosis. Unlike multiple myeloma, bony lesions are uncommon in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, whereas lymphadenopathy and organomegaly are uncommon in myeloma.Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell disorder which is often suspected and detected incidentally from routine blood workup. The patients are asymptomatic with no end-organ damage such as renal failure, hypercalcemia, anemia, or lytic bone lesion. The serum electrophoresis reveals an M spike but the amount of M-protein on immunofixation is usually less than 3 gm/dL and bone marrow contains less than 10% of monoclonal plasma cells. Monitoring of patients is important since MGUS can progress to multiple myeloma over a period of time. It is recommended to get the first evaluation 6 months after initial diagnosis followed by annual or biannual checkup.",

Chromosome analysis demonstrates a translocation between the immunuglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 and an unidentified gene on chromosome 8. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his phenotype?",
    "exp": "This case is an example of Burkitt's lymphoma, which may affect the tonsils or other lymphoid tissues. The translocation places the myc oncogene on chromosome 8 downstream of the very active heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, activating myc gene expression in B cells and their derivatives. The translocation is likely an aberrant form of the normal DNA rearrangements that generate unique heavy chain genes in each B cell. The translocation joins one chromosome 8 to one chromosome 14, leaving their homologues unaffected. The cause for the phenotype must therefore be trans-acting, since cis-acting effects would peain only to the translocated loci and not affect the homologous untranslocated loci. Activation of a tumor-promoting gene (oncogene) on chromosome 8 could produce an enlarged tonsil, while underactivity of immunoglobulin production due to one-half expression could decrease immune function but would not completely ablate the processes in choices a, b, d, and e. At the genetic level, trans-acting events are autosomal dominant in that one of the two homologous loci is abnormal and produces a phenotype.

    "question": "In the beginning of resuscitation effos, 0.5 mg of epinephrine is administered subcutaneously. Which adrenergic receptors, in which tissues, are responsible for the beneficial effect of epinephrine in this patient?",
    "exp": "Epinephrine is a non selective adrenergic agonist and a valuable resuscitative drug because of its effects at multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. In the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, accelerates hea rate, causes constriction of vascular smooth muscle, and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. The principal pharmacologic effects of epinephrine that are beneficial in anaphylaxis are mediated : alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, beta-1 receptors in the hea, resulting in increased contractility, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation and relief of bronchoconstriction. (One simple mnemonic for the respective locations of beta1 and beta2 receptors is \"one hea, two lungs.\") Beta-2 receptors are also found, however, in vascular smooth muscle (especially in skeletal muscle beds), were, just as in bronchial smooth muscle, they promote relaxation. (Epinephrine dilates skeletal muscle vascular beds to maximize oxygen delivery for the \"fight-or-flight\" response.) The resulting vasodilation in skeletal muscle vascular beds would, by itself, tend to decrease blood pressure, which might tend to worsen the effects of anaphylactic shock, but this effect is mitigated by the intense alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasoconstriction in multiple beds. The principal action of alpha-2 receptors is at the presynaptic nerve terminal, where receptor stimulation reduces the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminal. Epinephrine does stimulate these receptors, but it does not really contribute to the beneficial actions of epinephrine in resuscitation. Alpha-2 receptors are not located in the hea (except at presynaptic nerve terminals), alpha-2 receptors do not have a significant beneficial effect in resuscitation, and beta-1 receptors are not located in bronchial smooth muscle, but are located in the hea. Beta-1 receptors are located in the hea, not in bronchial smooth muscle. The adrenergic receptor that produces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation is beta-2. Alpha-2 receptors are located primarily at presynaptic nerve terminals, and because the beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cause vasodilation, this not a helpful effect of epinephrine in this case. Also Know: Epinephrine is indicated for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and acute asthma exacerbations. It is considered a first-line agent in the treatment of cardiac arrest (i.e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity). Epinephrine also causes bronchodilation and antagonizes the effects of histamine. Epinephrine significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption and thus can exacerbate ventricular irritability in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Extravasation causes necrosis and sloughing, and requires prompt infiltration of the affected area with phentolamine. Ref: Miller B.A., Clements E.A. (2011). Chapter 24.

His hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dl, platelet count 37 x 109/L and total leukocyte count 70 x 109/L, which included 80% eosinophils.

Journal Source: Ann Hematol. 2000 May;79(5):272-4. Authors: Jain P, Kumar R, Gujral S, Kumar A, Singh A, Jain Y, Dubey S, Anand M, Arya LS. A four-year-old boy presented with marked peripheral blood eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count of 54 x 10(9)/1), features of hypereosinophilic syndrome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L2), the latter characterized by the presence of granular blasts. Blasts were negative for myeloperoxidase, non-specific esterase, acid phosphatase, periodic-acid Schiff stain, and toluidine blue. They exhibited an early pre-B immunophenotype (TdT, CD19, CDIO, CD20 and CD22 positive) and stained negative for T (CD7, CD2, CD5 and CD3) and myeloid markers (MPO, CD33 and CD13). Chromosomal analysis revealed a normal karyotype. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first repo of the coexistence of granular ALL and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Why Hypereosinophillic Syndrome Option A Explanation Idiopathic hypereosinophillic syndrome is a rare condition characterized by extremely high levels of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. (80% of (70 x 109) Leucocytes were eosinophils in this patient) Clinical picture of dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing etc is fuher suggestive of HES. This is differentiated from eosinophillic leukaemia by the absence of eosinophilic blast cells.

    "question": "A 64-year-old man is evaluated because of weakness and difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation. The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit 2 weeks ago because of septic shock related to alcoholism, pneumonia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. He had developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as acute kidney injury. His pulmonary infiltrates had responded to appropriate intravenous antibiotics and his hypotension had responded to intravenous norepinephrine. Now the patient is alert and responsive to verbal commands, is afebrile with blood pressure of 114/74 but has not tolerated several trials of weaning from the ventilator. On physical examination, the patient is cooperative. Cranial nerves are normal. Muscle strength is poor, especially in distal musculature, where he displays only 2/5 strength in the hands and feet. Proximal strength is 3/5. Ankle and knee reflexes are unobtainable. Sensory examination is difficult because of problems communicating with the patient but suggests distal sensory loss in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show that his creatinine level has spontaneously improved to 2.4 mg/dL. Electrolytes are normal, and the patient has a mild normochromic normocytic anemia with resolving leukocytosis. Serum creatine kinase is 78 units/L (normal <140). What is the most likely cause of his weakness?",
    "exp": "This patient suffers from critical care polyneuropathy, which affects 25% to 50% of ICU patients who have suffered multiorgan failure or who have required long-term mechanical ventilation. It typically presents with motor weakness and difficulty in weaning the patient from the ventilator. Cranial nerves are spared. Distal reflex loss, sensory changes in neuropathic distribution, and normal CK help distinguish it from critical care myopathy. Both conditions can coexist in the same patient and distinction between the two conditions may not be important, as treatment of both conditions is supportive. Patients usually improve slowly with time, but prolonged dependence on the ventilator as well as weakness and sensory loss lasting months or years often occur. The cause of critical care polyneuropathy is unknown, but axonal degeneration on nerve conduction studies is characteristic.Loss of myosin characterizes the closely related condition of critical care myopathy, but sensory changes and reflex loss would not be anticipated in a myopathic process. Neuromuscular blockade again would not cause sensory and reflex changes. Thiamine deficiency can be provoked in a malnourished patient (such as one suffering from chronic alcoholism) but would be associated with nystagmus, ataxia, and mental status changes rather than distal weakness and neuropathy. Demyelination (rather than axonal degeneration) is associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome, but this condition would be very unlikely in this ICU patient without antecedent viral or Campylobacter infection.",

    "question": "A 25 year old patient with asthma arrives at the emergency depament complaining of extreme shoness of breath. He has been compliant with his medications, which are metaproterenol and inhaled betamethasone. Over the past 6 hours, his wheezing and shoness of breath have become increasingly severe. At present, his blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg and with deep inspiration falls to 116/56 mm Hg. His pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 32/min and labored. There is retraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscles with inspiration. There are soft wheezes and poor air movement diffusely throughout both lung fields. His peak expiratory flow rate is 60 L/min, and he is immediately staed on an albuterol nebulizer and given IV hydrocoisone. His aerial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.55, pCO2 of 21 mm Hg, and a pO2 of 60 mm Hg. Twenty minutes later, a repeat peak flow rate is still 60 L/min. A repeat aerial blood gas reveals that his pH is now 7.46, his pCO2 is now 34 mm Hg, and his pO2 is 64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "exp": "This patient is having a very severe asthmatic attack, as demonstrated by his severe shoness of breath, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and variation in blood pressure with breathing (due to establishing a very negative intrathoracic pressure with forced attempts at inspiration). The initial pO2 is markedly decreased at 60 (compared to the normal 100) mm Hg. His pCO2 is also decreased at 21 mm Hg initially, due to \"blowing off CO2\" with his increased respirations while trying to get enough oxygen. This causes his respiratory alkalosis with pH 7.55. He is then treated, but the treatment improves his pO2 only slightly. Despite this, his pCO2 rises, and his pH returns toward normal. This does not mean he is getting better. Instead, we are seeing worsening respiratory failure as his ability to ventilate decreases, causing the inappropriate rise in pCO2 even though he is still very badly hypoxic. This patient should therefore be prepared for possible intubation if there is not immediate improvement. Epinephrine no longer is used in the management protocols of acute asthma because of its high rate of toxicity. Administering 100% oxygen may be an adjunctive therapy, but at this point the patient is probably saturating above 90% anyway. Ref: Corbridge T., Hall J.B. (2005). Chapter 40. Status Asthmaticus.

    "exp": "A ruptured abdominal aneurysm is a surgical emergency often accompanied by serious hypotension and vascular collapse before surgery and massive fluid shifts with renal failure after surgery. In this case, all the hemodynamic parameters indicate inadequate intravascular volume, and the patient is therefore suffering from hypovolemic shock. The low urine output indicates poor renal perfusion, while the high urine-specific gravity indicates adequate renal function with compensatory free-water conservation. The administration of a vasopressor agent would ceainly raise the blood pressure, but it would do so by increasing peripheral vascular resistance and thereby fuher decrease tissue perfusion. The deleterious effects of shock would be increased. A vasodilating agent to lower the systemic vascular resistance would lead to profound hypotension and possibly complete vascular collapse because of pooling of an already depleted vascular volume. This patient's blood pressure is critically dependent on an elevated systemic vascular resistance. A diuretic would exacerbate the patient's existing volume depletion. To properly treat this patient, rapid fluid infusion and expansion of the intravascular volume must be undeaken. This can be easily done with lactated Ringer solution or blood (or both) until improvements in such parameters as the PCWP, urine output, and blood pressure are noted.",

He takes metoprolol for hypertension and naproxen for the arthritis. He has occasionally awakened in the night with mild dyspnea relieved by sitting up but has not noticed edema. Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows stable left ventricular hypertrophy; no Q waves are seen. Chest x-ray shows increased interstitial markings and some cephalization of flow to the upper lobe vessels. The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%). What is the likely pathogenesis of this patient's dyspnea?",
    "exp": "The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF.",

However, the November 6 illness (a) was not caused by nH1N1 influenza virus; the low titers (10 on November 6 and 10 on November 30) most likely represent cross-reacting antibodies from the agent that caused her first illness. The greater than fourfold rise in titer from 10 on November 30 (baseline) to 160 on December 20 reflects a definitive diagnostic rise in antibody against nH1N1 influenza virus.

Abdominal aneurysms are commonly asymptomatic, but acute rupture may occur without warning. Some will expand and become painful, with pain as a harbinger of rupture. The risk of rupture increases with the size of the aneurysm The 5-year risk of rupture is 1% to 2% if the aneurysm is less than 5 cm, but 20% to 40% if the size is greater than 5 cm Other studies indicate that, in patients with AAAs less than 5.5 cm, there is no difference in mortality rate between those followed with ultrasound and those who undergo elective aneurysmal repair. Therefore, operative repair is typically recommended in asymptomatic individuals when the AAA diameter is greater than 5.5 cm; other indications for surgery are rapid expansion or onset of symptoms. With careful preoperative evaluation and postoperative care, the surgical mortality rate should be less than 1% to 2%.

    "exp": "This woman with poorly controlled diabetes has developed hyperglycemia and lethargy during an episode suggestive of viral gastroenteritis. Her presentation is most consistent with hyperosmolar nonketotic state. This condition typically occurs in type 2 diabetics who become volume depleted and develop renal insufficiency. Glucose is no longer able to spill out into the urine, the blood glucose skyrockets, and severe hypertonicity leads to brain dysfunction and coma. Serum osmolarity is calculated by the formula:18Plasmaglucose +2(Na++K+)+2.8bloodureanitrogen This patient's serum osmolarity is as follows:181100 +(126+4)+2.884 =61+260+30=351Thus, the serum osmolarity is greater than 350 mOsm/L. Although the serum sodium is usually the main determinant of osmolarity, extreme hyperglycemia contributes significantly to this patient's hypertonicity. Osmotically active particles in the extracellular fluid space pull water out of the intracellular space. This causes cellular dehydration in the brain and consequently the patient's CNS changes.Diabetic ketoacidosis would be associated with a much lower serum bicarbonate level and with an elevated anion gap. This patient's anion gap is 9 mEq/L (126-), which is well within the normal range. This patient's hyponatremia is minimal and is related to the osmotic effects of hyperglycemia. Patients with SIADH have an inappropriate production of ADH, leading to water retention and consequent hypotonicity (not hypertonicity, as in this case). The diagnosis of SIADH or drug-induced hyponatremia cannot be made in the setting of severe hypovolemia. Although the oral hypoglycemic chlorpropamide can cause drug-induced hyponatremia, this patient was not taking a sulfonylurea. Although meningitis can be associated with hyponatremia, this patient's hypertonicity and lack of meningeal signs point toward hyperosmolar nonketotic state as the cause of her illness.",

    "exp": "The iron concentration and iron-binding capacity are low; however, in contrast to the finding in anemia of iron deficiency, the serum ferritin level is increased. This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Metastases are space-occupying lesions (myelophthisic process) that can lead to leukoerythroblastosis, with nucleated RBCs and immature WBCs appearing on the peripheral blood smear.",

Monoglyceride lipase then converts the monoacylglycerol to a free fatty acid and glycerol.The hormone-sensitive lipase of adipose tissue is responsible for degrading diacylglycerol to a free fatty acid and monoacylglycerol. The enzyme is activated by glucagon via a cAMP-mediated process (the activation of protein kinase A). Thus, mutations in PKA or the glucagon receptor may interfere with the eventual phosphorylation and activation of the hormone-sensitive lipase. Adenylate kinase is not involved in this cascade (although a mutation in adenylate cyclase would be involved, as that is the enzyme that produces cAMP).

    "question": "A perimenopausal woman presents with increasing swallowing difficulty and fatigue. Physical examination reveals that her thyroid is enlarged (palpable goiter). Laboratory examination of her serum reveals T4 of 4.9 mg/dL, free T4 of 2.5 ng/dL, and TSH of 5.5 mIU/mL. No thyroidstimulating immunoglobulins are identified in the serum, but antimicrosomal antibodies are present. Which one of the listed histologic findings, if present in a thyroid biopsy from this individual, would be most consistent with a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
    "exp": "Four types of thyroiditis may be associated with hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, one of the autoimmune thyroid diseases, is associated with the HLA-B8 haplotype and high titers of circulating autoantibodies, including antimicrosomal, antithyroglobulin, and anti-TSH receptor antibodies. This abnormality is not uncommon in the United States. Histologically, there is infiltration of the thyroid stroma by an intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, with the formation of lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. This produces destruction and atrophy of the follicles and transforms the thyroid follicular cells into acidophilic cells. There are many different names for these cells, including oxyphilic cells, oncocytes, Huhle cells, and Askanazy cells. Not uncommonly, patients develop hypothyroidism as a result of follicle disruption, and the manifestations consist of fatigue, myxedema, cold intolerance, hair coarsening, and constipation. Rarely, cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop hypehyroidism (Hashitoxicosis), while the combination of Hashimoto's disease, pernicious anemia, and type I diabetes mellitus is called Schmidt's syndrome. This is one type of multiglandular syndrome. Although subacute thyroiditis and Riedel's thyroiditis may have similar symptoms to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, biopsy findings in these disorders are distinctly different. Subacute (de Quervain's, granulomatous, or giant cell) thyroiditis is a self-limited viral infection of the thyroid. It typically follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients develop the acute onset of fever and painful thyroid enlargement, and may develop a transient hypothyroidism. Histologically there is destruction of the follicles with a granulomatous reaction and multinucleated giant cells that surround fragments of colloid. One-half of patients with Riedel's thyroiditis are hypothyroid, but, in contrast to the other types of thyroiditis, microscopic examination reveals dense fibrosis of the thyroid gland, often extending into extrathyroidal soft tissue. This fibrosis produces a rock-hard enlarged thyroid gland that may produce the feeling of suffocation. This combination of signs and symptoms may be mistaken clinically for a malignant process. Additionally, these patients may develop similar fibrosis in the mediastinum or retroperitoneum. Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is also a self-limited, painless enlargement of the thyroid that is associated with hypothyroidism, but that lacks antithyroid antibodies or lymphoid germinal centers within the thyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

    "question": "A 60-year-old man has had angina on exertion for the past 6 years. A coronary angiogram performed 2 years ago showed 75% stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and 50% stenosis of the right coronary artery. For the past 3 weeks, the frequency and severity of his anginal attacks have increased, and pain sometimes occurs even when he is lying in bed. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 85/min with irregular beats. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation. Laboratory studies show serum glucose, 188 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL; and troponin I, 1.5 ng/mL. Which of the following is most likely to explain these findings?",
    "exp": "Marked coronary artery occlusion with this degree of stenosis prevents adequate perfusion of the heart when myocardial demand is increased during exertion. He has angina on exertion and recently developed unstable angina, which is manifested by increased frequency and severity of the attacks and angina at rest. The ST-segment elevation suggests a developing acute coronary syndrome with myocardial ischemia, but the lack of cardiac enzyme elevation suggests infarction has not yet occurred. In most patients, unstable angina is induced by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque followed by a mural thrombus and possibly distal embolization, vasospasm, or both. An acute myocardial infarction (MI) can lead to focal fibrinous pericarditis, but it is unlikely to lead to extensive scarring that surrounds the heart. Fibrosis is a late finding from the healing of infarction. Hypertrophy of the heart is unlikely to progress significantly in this case because there is neither hypertension nor a valvular lesion.

The most likely candidate for this action is the intestinal peptide known as gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), which obviously was named for its effects on the stomach. GIP secretion is increased during ingestion of glucose and the blood level produced is sufficient to stimulate insulin secretion. Because of this effect on insulin secretion, GIP is sometimes referred to as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. Activation of the sympathetic innervation to the pancreas inhibits insulin secretion an a2-adrenergic mechanism. Hence, any sympathetic reflexes activated during ingestion of glucose would decrease insulin secretion. While paracrine release of somatostatin by D cells in the islets does inhibit insulin secretion by b cells, there is no reason to suspect that intravenous versus ingested glucose would have a differential effect on somatostatin release. The same holds true for glucagon secretion by a cells. Fuhermore, glucagon has a paracrine effect to increase insulin secretion.",

    "exp": "The patient's history suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The combination of elevated troponin and lack of ST segment elevation on ECG is most consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Initial therapy for acute coronary syndrome includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, anticoagulation, and morphine. An intravenous beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, is frequently given in the immediate management of ACS to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, limit infarct size, reduce pain, and decrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Elevated blood pressure also increases myocardial oxygen demand. Given this patient's increased blood pressure and continued pain, administration of a beta-blocker is the appropriate next step in his management. Administration of intravenous morphine would also be appropriate.Cardiac catheterization may well be necessary at some point during his evaluation, but there is no mortality benefit for emergent catheterization in NSTEMI. There is no role for thrombolytic therapy in patients with ACS without ST segment elevation. All patients with ACS should be admitted to a monitored cardiac unit with serial cardiac biomarkers to estimate the extent of cardiac damage, but the patient's continued pain demands urgent treatment, not just further observation. Clopidogrel therapy is indicated for patients with ACS who will not be undergoing immediate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The most likely explanation for an exudative pleural effusion in the setting of an acute pneumonia is a parapneumonic effusion. Parapneumonic effusions occur in about 40% of patients with bacterial pneumonia. Parapneumonic effusions are exudative due to the fact that there is increased permeability of the visceral pleural membrane capillaries, and interstitial fluid moves across the visceral pleura into the pleural space. Parapneumonic effusions may be simple or complicated. Simple parapneumonic effusions are sterile and free flowing. If bacteria invade the pleural space, neutrophils move into the pleural space and anaerobic metabolism of glucose results in a low pleural fluid pH (<7.20) and glucose (<60). The characteristics of this patient's pleural fluid suggest that bacterial invasion of the pleural space has not occurred, and that this is a simple parapneumonic effusion. Hemorrhage into the pleural space occurs with trauma, cancer, and pulmonary embolism, but rarely with pneumonia.",

When anticonvulsant medications are used, pregnant women have an even greater risk of congenital malformations. It is recommended that women undergo a trial of being weaned off their medications prior to becoming pregnant. If antiseizure medications must be used, monotherapy is preferred to minimize the risk to the fetus since the incidence of fetal anomalies increases as additional anticonvulsants are consumed. Many anticonvulsants have been found to impair folate metabolism, and folate supplementation in pregnancy has been associated with a decreased incidence of congenital anomalies in epileptic women taking antiseizure medications.

His temperature is 36.9 C (98.5 F), his blood pressure is 158/98 mm Hg and his pulse is 82/minute and regular. On examination, the physician notes a non tender, pulsatile, mass in the mid-abdomen. A plain abdominal x-ray film with the patient in the lateral position reveals spotty calcification of a markedly dilated abdominal aoic walI. Which of the following physiologic observations helps to account for the fact that 75% of the aneurysms of this patient's type are found in the abdomen and only 25% principally involve the thorax?",
    "exp": "Increased blood pressure is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis, and humans pay a price for their erect sitting and standing postures. In these postures, the abdominal aoa experiences the weight of a column of blood added to the pressure produced by the hea. In the supine posture, the pressures in the thoracic and abdominal aoa are similar. So, if an average daily pressure is taken, the abdominal aoa tends to have a significantly higher pressure than does the thoracic aoa. Diastolic pressure is actually greater in the thoracic aoa compared to the abdominal aoa in the supine position. However, the systolic blood pressure is greater in the abdominal aoa. A negative intrathoracic pressure would tend to increase transmural pressure across the wall of the thoracic aoa, and thereby increase wall tension and promote the development of aneurysms. Blood flow in the abdominal aoa is less than that in the thoracic aoa, because some blood leaves the aoa through its thoracic branches. Ref: Creager M.A., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 248.

    "exp": "Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) arising from variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) are the basis of the DNA fingerprinting technique. The process is: (1) isolation of DNA from parent/child or forensicspecimens using blood, skin, or semen; (2) PCR amplification and radioactive labeling of DNA from variable regions in each sample; (3) separation of the variable DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis; and (4) comparison of the DNA fragment patterns among samples. Since numbers of arrays of repeats of two, three, or four base pairs (microsatellites) may vary from 5 to 100 at a paicular chromosome locus, paicular alleles may occur in less than 1% of the population. As a result, analysis of three loci, each with two alleles, can produce odds as high as (100)6 that the pattern matches a putative father or suspect as compared to a random person from the general population. Reverse transcription based upon RNA-directed DNA synthesis is not utilized in DNA fingerprinting, and the size distribution of undigested DNA reflects its integrity during isolation rather than individual identify. HLA typing uses antibodies to define the constellation of alleles from various loci in the HLA region on chromosome 6. The tendency for ceain HLA alleles to occur together (associate) on the same chromosome as haplotypes greatly reduces their odds of identity when compared to DNA fingerprinting.",

    "exp": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an increased bleeding time but a decreased platelet count. It causes purpura, fever, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and microthrombi, frequently in young women. Elevated indirect bilirubin and high LDH are characteristic, as are schistocytes in the blood smear, renal dysfunction, and neurologic and systemic symptoms. Negative findings impoant to rule out similar conditions include a negative Coombs test and absence of fibrin split products. TTP is thought to be initiated by endothelial injury, which releases ceain procoagulant materials into the circulation, causing platelet aggregation. This condition may be precipitated by pregnancy or use of estrogens. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause anemia and an elevated indirect bilirubin, but generally produces only mild symptoms, is not associated with thrombocytopenia, and does not cause fragmentation of red blood cells on the peripheral smear. The negative Coombs test argues against autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be differentiated from TTP because of abnormal coagulation tests. In DIC, microangiopathic hemolysis is also present, but the prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT) are prolonged, fibrinogen levels are reduced, and fibrin split products are elevated.

Pathological changes comprise necrotising inflammation and vessel occlusion, and in 70% of patients aeritis of the vasa nervorum leads to neuropathy, which is typically symmetrical and affects both sensory and motor function.

HbNl: AAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGC HbCr: AAGAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGCUUUC >>> UAU UAA Which of the following would account for the development of HbCr?",
    "exp": "Looking at the coding segment of the normal b-gene of hemoglobin, one should read the information codon by codon, as follows: AAG UAU CAC UAA GCU CGC 1 2 3 4 5 6 The normal b-globin gene has a stop codon (UAA) at the 4th position, therefore the last 2 codons (GCU and CGC) are not translated and do not code for amino acid residues found in the protein. Comparing this information to the coding segment of the mutated b-gene of hemoglobin Cranston, one would notice the following: AAG AGU AUC ACU AAG CUC GCU UUC UAU UAA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 etc etc The inseion of two base pairs (AG) results in a frameshift mutation that eliminates the stop codon at position 4, thereby causing the addition of amino acids normally not translated in the hemoglobin b-chain of the child. Since the chain is now too long, this destabilizes the tetrameric conformation of hemoglobin. A frameshift mutation resulting in deletion of several amino acids is wrong, since such a mutation would have inseed a stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) before position 4. A mutation in the stop codon would have resulted in a longer-than-normal b-globin gene, but the information given does not indicate any changes in the stop codon at position 4. Interestingly, a chain elongation by mutation in the stop codon exists and is known as hemoglobin Constant Spring, affecting the a-chain of hemoglobin. A point mutation is the result of a single base pair change, which is not the case here. A point mutation resulting in the inseion of a new stop codon is called a nonsense mutation, and it would result in a shoer-than-normal protein. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 37.

Correct treatment for the affected patient includes administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the neuromuscular effect of potassium) and administration of sodium ions (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium- potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy given the acute need to reduce the potassium level.

    "exp": "Warfarin is metabolized by a specific subset of induced P450 isozymes. The P450 system is used by cells to modify the xenobiotic (in this case the warfarin) such that it can be more easily excreted. Erythromycin, along with other macrolide antibiotics, inhibits the P450 oxidizing system, which in this case would lead to a higher blood level of warfarin and, therefore, the balance of clotting and bleeding is shifted toward excessive bleeding. A stimulation of P450 production by erythromycin would lead to a lower level of warfarin (because of increased metabolism and loss of warfarin by P450) and the potential for excessive clotting. This effect of P450 is a common drug-drug interaction. The causative agents of community- acquired pneumonia do not affect vitamin K absorption in the small intestine, or distribution throughout the body.

Iron supplementation alone would be helpful for short term, but anemia would appear again after therapy if proper diet is not followedIRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA* Most common type of anemia worldwide* Chronic blood loss is the most common cause of iron deficiencyIron absorption increased byIron absorption reduced by* Heme iron (10-20% absorbed)* Ferrous form (Fe2+)* Animal foods* Acid pH* Vitamin C* Increased erythropoiesis* Pregnancy* Hypoxia* Amino acids, Sugar* Iron deficiency* Non heme iron (1-5% absorbed)* Plant foods* Ferric form (Fe 3+)* Alkali pH* Iron overload* Achlorhydria* Phytates, tannates in tea* Decreased erythropoiesis* Inflammatory disorders On an average, only 10% to 15% of ingested iron is absorbed The major iron transporter from the diet across the intestinal lumen - ferroportin Iron absorbed from the diet or released from stores circulates in the plasma bound to transferrin, the iron transport proteinStages of Iron deficiencyNegative iron balanceIron deficient erythropoiesisIron deficiency anemia* Demands exceed the body's ability to absorb iron from diet* Serum ferritin decrease* Stainable iron on bone marrow aspirations decrease* Serum iron, TIBC, red cell protoporphyrin levels, RBC indices, morphology - normal* Marrow iron stores depleted - Serum iron decreases - TIBC & Red cell protoporphyrin levels increases - Transferrin saturation decreases - first appearance of microcytic cells, hypochromic reticulocytes* Decreased Hb* Decreased hematocrit* Transferrin saturation: 10 -15%* Hb<7g/dL: target cells and poikilocytes* Within the erythroid cell, iron in excess of the amount needed for hemoglobin synthesis binds to a storage protein, apoferritin, forming ferritin* Serum ferritin level is the most useful test to diagnose iron deficiency* Serum ferritin level is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores* Average Se ferritin levels: Adult males -100 mg/L; adult females - 30 mg/L* Marrow iron stores are absent when the serum ferritin level is <15 mg/L.* Transferrin receptor protein (TRP) - increased in absolute iron deficiency* MCCs of increased red cell protoporphyrin levels - absolute or relative iron deficiency and lead poisoning.Treatment* 300mg elemental iron daily* Reticulocyte count begins to rise within 4-7 days after initiation of therapy* Failure of response to iron therapy is usually due to noncompliance* Parenteral Iron indications - intolerance to oral iron, refractoriness to oral iron, gastrointestinal disease, and continued blood loss* For parenteral iron therapy, Amount of iron needed= Body weight (kg) x 2.3 x (15 - patient's Hb ) + 500 or 1000 mg",

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman has had a fever for 5 days. On physical examination, her temperature is 38.2deg C, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. A cardiac murmur is heard on auscultation. Her sensorium is clouded, but there are no focal neurologic deficits. Laboratory findings include hemoglobin, 13.1 g/dL; platelet count, 233,300/ mm3; and WBC count, 19,200/ mm3. Blood cultures are positive for gram-positive bacteria. Urinalysis shows hematuria. An echocardiogram shows 1.5-cm vegetation on the mitral valve. Which of the following conditions is this patient most likely to develop?",
    "exp": "She developed bacterial septicemia followed by infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. Thus she has a high risk for developing complications of infective endocarditis. Such valvular vegetations are destructive of the valve. The impaired functioning of the mitral valve (most likely regurgitation) would give rise to left atrial dilation and left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema. Septic emboli from the mitral valve vegetation could reach the systemic circulation and give rise to abscesses. The infection of an arterial wall can weaken the wall, resulting in aneurysm formation and the potential for rupture. Dilated cardiomyopathy may be due to chronic alcoholism, or it may be idiopathic. It may be familial, or it may follow myocarditis, but it is not a direct complication of infective endocarditis. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve results from a defect in connective tissue, whether well-defined or unknown; the mitral valve leaflets are enlarged, hooded, and redundant. Lesions on the right side of the valve can produce septic emboli that involve the lungs, but vegetations on the left side embolize to the systemic circulation, producing lesions in the spleen, kidneys, or brain. Pulmonary abscesses can occur from right-sided infective endocarditis because septic emboli pour into the pulmonary arterial circulation.",
